Sorry to see you go. If you didn't mean to unsubscribe, you can always re-subscribe using the form below.

<!-- Don't edit this file in the `/themes/` folder -->
<!-- Instead, copy and paste it it into the root of _your_ `/content/` folder -->
<!-- _Then_ you can edit it -->
<!-- Otherwise it could be overwritten if you pull theme updates -->
<!-- You can (and should) delete this comment in _your_ version of this file ... -->
<!-- ... to avoid future confusion -->
