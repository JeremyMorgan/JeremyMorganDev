/* 
Don't edit this file in the `/themes/` folder
If you do, it may be overwritten when you pull theme updates.

Instead, create a blank file at <your repo>/assets/scss/_custom.scss
You may need to create the `assets` and/or `scss` folder(s) to do so.
Also please note the leading underscore in the filename.

All your custom CSS or SCSS can then go in that file.

Note, if you want to tweak colors, font sizes, or the column width,
take a look at /assets/scss/_variables.scss in the theme folder first.
The comment in that file will explain the process further.
